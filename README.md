Explanation:

First, we import the RandomForestClassifier class from the sklearn.ensemble module.
We create an instance of the RandomForestClassifier class, specifying the number of trees in the forest using the n_estimators parameter.
Next, we train the classifier by calling the fit method and passing in the training data (X_train and y_train).
Finally, we make predictions on the test data (X_test) using the predict method, and store the predicted values in y_pred.
